## Notes

* Had to change usb connection from file transfer to MIDI to download the app on a physical phone
* Had to change "implementation 'commons-io: commons-io: 2.8'" to "implementation group: 'commons-io', name: 'commons-io', version: '2.8.0'" in build.gradle so that the commons-io library would work properly
* Had to use the import "org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils" in MainActivity.java since "android.os.FileUtils" is the wrong import that Android Studio wants add
* Had to make sure to use Java instead of Kotlin when setting up the app in the beginning
